# CLASS DECRIPTION: A Canon object represents an instance of a canon.
# MEMBER VARIABLES:
## metadata (Metadata) - this is the object that contains all the information about the canon.
## concrete_scale (array of integers) - this array contains all the possible notes that can be used in this canon.
## canon_skeleton (canon representation using arrays) - the canon with only the root notes filled in.
## canon_complete (canon representation using arrays) - the fully fleshed out canon.
# INTERFACE METHODS
## get_metadata - returns the metadata object associated with this canon. This is not necessarily the same as that which was passed in to initialise the canon.
## get_canon_as_array - returns the internal representation of the canon.
